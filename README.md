I've made this script for myself but it can be useful for someone else. The search is case-insensitive, "." and ".*" are supported.
The script is modification of [drogers141/mpv-playlist-navigator](https://github.com/drogers141/mpv-playlist-navigator).
Keep in mind that this is my first time using Lua.

## Installation

Copy "main.lua" and "search.lua" to "~/.config/mpv/scripts/mpv-slash-search/".
